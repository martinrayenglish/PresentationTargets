# Presentation Targets
This module is an improved version of Sitecore's Item Rendering adapted from [Vasiliy Fomichev's True Item Rendering](https://www.cmsbestpractices.com/sitecore-item-rendering-best-practice/).

## So, what does this module do for me?
To put it simply; this is rendering that can target any renderings inside any placeholders on an existing item and render their content.

## What does it consist of?
- Presentation Targets Rendering and patch file.
- This rendering and out-of-the-box Item Rendering can live in harmony.
